# Task Management System

This project implements a database schema for a task management system using SQLAlchemy and Alembic for migrations. The database schema is based on the provided diagram, and the `.env` file is used to configure the database connection.

## Database Models

The database consists of the following tables:

1. **users**: Stores user details such as username and role.
2. **roles**: Defines roles assigned to users.
3. **permissions**: Specifies various permissions.
4. **role_permission**: Links roles with permissions.
5. **personal_access_tokens**: Manages user authentication tokens.
6. **articles**: Stores article details written by users.
7. **categories**: Categorizes articles.
8. **tags**: Allows tagging of articles.
9. **article_tag**: Maps articles to tags.
10. **comments**: Stores comments for articles.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

1. Python installed on your system.
2. PostgreSQL database server running locally or remotely.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/salehzt100/task3.git
   cd task3
2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   
3. Install the required dependencies:
   
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Set up the .env file: Ensure .env contains the following:
   
   ```bash
   DB_CONNECTION=postgresql+psycopg2
   DB_HOST=localhost
   DB_PORT=5432
   DB_DATABASE=task3_db
   DB_USERNAME=postgres
   DB_PASSWORD=2222
   
### Running Migrations

1. Initialize Alembic:
   
   ```bash
   alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Initial migration"

2. Generate a migration:
   
   ```bash
    alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Initial migration"
   
3. Apply the migration:
   
   ```bash
    alembic upgrade head
4. Run Seeder to Populate Initial Roles After applying migrations, run the seeder script to populate the roles table:
   
   ```bash
   python seeder/role_seeder.py
   
   # The role_seeder.py script ensures essential roles like Admin, Editor, and Viewer are created for the system.

### Code Description

The project uses SQLAlchemy ORM to define the models based on the provided schema. Alembic handles schema migrations.

Key Components

* SQLAlchemy Models: Each table is represented as a Python class using SQLAlchemy's ORM. Relationships between tables are defined using ForeignKey and relationship.
* Alembic Migrations: Alembic is used to track changes in the models and update the database schema accordingly.
* Environment Configuration: Database credentials and connection details are stored in a .env file for flexibility and security.
